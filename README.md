Note:
In the zip/rar file, we've also added an empty folder called _Test_ to test out the 'cd' functionality of the shell.

There is also a batchfile which consists of a few commands. Once you've run 'make' to compile, execute the following to run the shell with the batchfile:

./myshell batchfile

There is also a user_manual.txt file for the purposes of demonstrating the 'help' command in the shell. The text file doesn't actually consist of any info.
